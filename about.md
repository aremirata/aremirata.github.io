Alger Remirata is a data scientist/ research scientist 
with specialization in healthcare, biotechnology and fraud analytics.

Below are some highlights of his professional career.

- More than nine years of experience in data science starting from ideation, research, development, deployment and maintenance
- Vast experience with machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised)
- Experience in deep learning (convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, transformer models)
- Comprehensive experience with various databases (MSSQL/Postgres, MongoDB, Neo4j, DynamoDB/Athena, Big Query, ElasticSearch)
- Significant experience with big data analytics such as Apache Spark (PySpark, Scala), Hive, Hadoop
- Substantial experience in Data Visualization, Natural Language Processing, Speech Analytics, Signal Processing, Computer Vision
- Diverse and well-rounded skills in handling various datasets: transactional data, application interaction data, content data, healthcare
claims data, clinical data, physiological data, wearable signal data, text data, audio data, images, videos, etc.)

Alger received a BS in [Mathematics](https://cs.upcebu.edu.ph/academics/mathematics-and-statistics/)
in 2011 from the
University of the Philippines Cebu, and a
MS in [Mathematics](https://www.uplbgraduateschool.org/academic-programs/mathematics-math/) in 2018 from the
University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os.

Alger started working as a data science researcher in Savvysherpa in 2013. [Savvysherpa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/savvysherpa-inc/) is a research-based company that combines healthcare economics and data science to produce valuable healthcare assets. It has offices in Minnesota, Utah and Cebu, Philippines. In 2018, Savvysherpa was acquired by United Health Group, becoming UHG R&D and then later became part of [Optum Labs](https://www.optumlabs.com/).

Before Savvysherpa was acquired by United Health Group, the company worked with multiple clients across various industries ranging from healthcare, telecommunications and retail.Since UHG is the primary partner of Savvysherpa, most of the projects has been concentrated with healthcare, clinical data and medical claims data. In Savvysherpa, Alger first developed his skills in machine learning under the supervision of the heads of Algorithms Group: Berton Earnshaw and Ben Mabey, now working with [Recursion Pharmaceuticals](https://www.recursion.com/). Common techniques to process medical claims data involves natural language processing and factorization methods. Digital signal processing has been utilized for projects related to the motion program developed by Savvysherpa which is now called [UnitedHealthCare Motion](https://unitedhealthcaremotion.com/). Similarly, Alger has been involve in some early projects revolving around Type 2 Diabetes, which later developed into [level2](https://mylevel2.com/our-approach/). Outside projects with UHG, Alger worked with projects in telecommunication and operations.

In Summer 2017, Alger participated in a Math bootcamp program called [Interdisciplinary Mentoring Program in Analysis, Computation, and Theory](https://magazine.byu.edu/article/math-boot-camp/) under the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey C. Humpherys.
