Alger Remirata is a data scientist/ research scientist 
with specialization in healthcare, biotechnology and fraud analytics.

Below are some highlights of his professional career.

- More than nine years of experience in data science starting from ideation, research, development, deployment and maintenance
- Vast experience with machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised)
- Experience in deep learning (convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, transformer models)
- Comprehensive experience with various databases (MSSQL/Postgres, MongoDB, Neo4j, DynamoDB/Athena, Big Query, ElasticSearch)
- Significant experience with big data analytics such as Apache Spark (PySpark, Scala), Hive, Hadoop
- Substantial experience in Data Visualization, Natural Language Processing, Speech Analytics, Signal Processing, Computer Vision
- Diverse and well-rounded skills in handling various datasets: transactional data, application interaction data, content data, healthcare
claims data, clinical data, physiological data, wearable signal data, text data, audio data, images, videos, etc.)

Alger earned a BS in [Mathematics](https://cs.upcebu.edu.ph/academics/mathematics-and-statistics/) from the University of the Philippines Cebu in 2011, followed by an
MS in [Mathematics](https://www.uplbgraduateschool.org/academic-programs/mathematics-math/) from the University of the Philippines Los Baños in 2018.

Alger commenced his role as a data science researcher at Savvysherpa in 2013. [Savvysherpa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/savvysherpa-inc/), a research-oriented company, amalgamates healthcare economics and data science to generate valuable healthcare assets. The company maintains offices in Minnesota, Utah, and Cebu, Philippines. In 2018, UnitedHealth Group acquired Savvysherpa, incorporating it into UHG R&D, eventually making it an integral part of [Optum Labs](https://www.optumlabs.com/). Due to UHG’s collaboration with Savvysherpa, Alger primarily concentrated on projects involving healthcare, clinical data, and medical claims data. Under the mentorship of Berton Earnshaw and Ben Mabey, heads of the Algorithms Group, Alger honed his machine learning skills, employing techniques such as natural language processing and factorization methods for processing medical claims data. Digital signal processing played a role in projects related to the motion program initially developed by Savvysherpa, now known as [UnitedHealthCare Motion](https://unitedhealthcaremotion.com/). Similarly, Alger was involved in early projects related to Type 2 Diabetes, which subsequently evolved into [level2](https://mylevel2.com/our-approach/)

He participated in the Math bootcamp program [Interdisciplinary Mentoring Program in Analysis, Computation, and Theory](https://magazine.byu.edu/article/math-boot-camp/) in Summer 2017, sponsored by Savvysherpa, honing his scientific computation and data science skills under Dr. Jeffrey C. Humpherys' supervision.

Transitioning to Jewel Paymentech in November 2018, a Singapore-based financial risk technology company, Alger focused on developing deployable AI engines for real-time fraud detection systems, scoring transactions for fraud risk within milliseconds.

Joining Neuroglee Therapeutics by November 2021, a biotech startup specializing in cognitive care programs, Alger collaborated with multidisciplinary teams to design recommendation systems for personalized care delivery. He led the design and construction of machine learning-based speech analytics pipelines to identify cognitive impairment and analyze digital biomarkers from various data sources, including applications, wearables, and audio.
